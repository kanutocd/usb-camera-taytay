# Architecture Constraints

```yaml
---
application: One Linux reference application; one configured MVP1 input directory;
  one configured MVP2 V4L2 device.
cli: Rust CLI; command names and behavior should be consumer-oriented and documented
  before being treated as stable.
mvp_boundary: MVP1 consumes completed files from an external producer or fixtures;
  MVP2 replaces that producer with a pure Rust V4L2 capture loop.
artifact_contract: Filesystem and V4L2 source boundaries produce the same Taytay Artifact
  contract; only complete, stable, readable artifacts are emitted.
durability: Publication is atomic and checksum-bound before upload; the durable ledger
  is authoritative for local job state; the remote TUS offset is authoritative for
  resumable transfer.
retry: Retries are bounded and classified; permanent authorization or protocol failures
  are not hidden as transport retries.
upload_boundary: Use published lunsaran-taytay and lunsaran-entregar integrations
  and Taytay ArtifactUploader; no application-specific HTTP or TUS upload path.
local_tests: Synthetic fixtures and camera-independent tests are required; camera
  hardware is not required for ordinary unit and mock acceptance.
hardware: MVP2 targets one configured /dev/video* device and initially supports one
  verified pixel format, resolution, and frame interval.
operations: Keep the application unprivileged and use a narrowly scoped writable spool;
  bound memory, segment size, spool, and capture-to-upload pressure.
deployment: Local reference application and integration example; no hosted control
  plane or production deployment scope is defined.
```
